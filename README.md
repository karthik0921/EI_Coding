# Exercise 1:

## 1)Behavioral Pattern:

### i)Observer Pattern:

Description: The code demonstrates the Observer design pattern, where multiple observers are notified and updated with messages from a subject in real-time.

### ii)Strategy Pattern:

Description: The code illustrates the Strategy design pattern by dynamically switching between different navigation strategies (local train, bus, walking) to navigate from a start point to an end point.

## 2)Creational Pattern:

### i)Factory Method Pattern:

Description: The code demonstrates the Factory Method design pattern by allowing users to book bus seats on either a private or government bus, creating the appropriate bus type based on user input.

### ii)Singleton Pattern:

Description: The code demonstrates the Singleton design pattern by ensuring that only one instance of the `Logger` class is created and used throughout the application to log messages.

## 3)Structural Pattern:

### i)Adapter Pattern:

Description: The code demonstrates the Adapter design pattern by allowing the `OldVideoPlayer` to be used with the `VideoPlayer` interface, enabling compatibility with both old and new video player systems.

### ii)Composite Pattern:

Description: The code demonstrates the Composite design pattern by treating individual files and directories uniformly, allowing hierarchical composition and display of file system components.

# Exercise 2:

## Problem Statement: 

Design and implement a console-based application that helps astronauts organize their daily schedules. The application should allow users
to add, remove, and view daily tasks. Each task will have a description, start time, end time, and priority level.
